Repository for small snippets of lost code laying around my computer.

You can use any of this stuff as you want. 
It is under a very permissive license (FreeBSD License)

If you have any improvement ideas just send them in via a Pull Request. 
I'll add anything reasonable enough as soon as I have the time to process them.
